My Vimrc Config
===============

This repo hosts my personal vim config files.
They are very unlikely to be useful to anybody (excepting me) at this point.

Dependancies
============

Requires Vundle.vim which is available from github.

I found the following on vim.org.

* syntax/htmljinja.vim
* syntax/jinja.vim

Installation
============

* symlink this directory to ~/.vim
* symlink this directory to ~/.config/nvim
* git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
* Launch vim and run :PluginInstall

Vim Colortune
=============

The vim-colortune directory holds my simple, still unpolished plugin to easily tune 
the vim colors from inside vim.

Vim Potion
==========

The vim-potion directory holds the result of my attempt to learn vimscript along 
Steve Losh's book: Learn Vimscript The Hard Way: http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/
